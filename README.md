# GETTING STARTED with peaq sdk
Simple project allows the user to connect to the AGUNG testnet and use the peaq sdk to setup a decentralized ID, intitalize roles, read previously created DID information, etc

## Installation and setup
1. Install Node.js and npm

In order to get started you must have Node.js and npm package manager downloaded on your computer.

2. Install Dependencies

Next you must install of the dependencies located in the package.json file to have proper version control

```npm install```


## Run script / Tests
Can start the script with cmd:
```npm start```

This will start the main script execution by calling index.js. (Used index.js so unit tests won't execute peaq_sdk on import)

Can execute the tests with cmd:
```npm test```
